# RHLDark
A simple plugin to give Relic Hunters Legend a darker theme, and other UI changes that I think look cool.
### Issues
The plugin causes large issues during gameplay.
As the game does not like it when the UI is fiddled with.
Known issues:
 - Invisible Enemies: Typically Elites or Champions, affected enemies also cannot be shot as their hitboxes are also bugged
 - Broken Auto-Aim: While this plugin is active, your character cannot aim up or down. Making shooting enemies with even a slight difference in elevation a chore
 - Possible audio glitches: Sometimes audio (such as gunshots) may not play
### Install
The plugin runs via BepInEx 5. Installing BepInEx is trivial, but RHL uses stripped assemblies. Requiring the original to be present. There are two downloads, one with BepInEx fully setup with original assemblies, and another with just the plugin alone.
### Compiling
Compiling the plugin requires having the game on hand. Meaning you must have gotten lucky.
Just add the missing assemblies back into the project and compile.
