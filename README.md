# RHLDark
A simple plugin to give Relic Hunters Legend a darker theme, and other UI changes that I think look cool.
### Install
The plugin runs via BepInEx 5. Installing BepInEx is trivial, but RHL uses stripped assemblies. Requiring the original to be present. There are two downloads, one with BepInEx fully setup with original assemblies, and another with just the plugin alone.
### Compiling
Compiling the plugin requires having the game on hand. Meaning you must have gotten lucky.
Just add the missing assemblies back into the project and compile.
